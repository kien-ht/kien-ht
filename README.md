## Hey hey hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kien

I have been working passionately as a web developer since 2019.

I'm a full time developer based in Cambodia and I'm a maintainer of [cypress-image-diff](https://github.com/uktrade/cypress-image-diff), a visual regression plugin for Cypress.

"Code with passion, create with purpose."
